<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Proper handling of your information with due regard to your personal rights as well as observance of your right to informational self-determination when using your personal data is a major concern to us. Collection, processing, and use of your personal data conform with relevant legal provisions, particularly in accordance with European data protection directives and their implementation in national laws. Work In Progress reserves the right to adapt this privacy policy to amended statutory provisions and regulations at any time. Please keep up with changes to our privacy policy by downloading it from our website using the appropriate link.</p>

<h2>(1) Automatic collection, processing, and use of personal data</h2>

<h3>(1.1) Web service log files</h3>

<p>When you access the web pages of our website with your browser, our server automatically stores the information required for the operation of a web service in log files, including the name of your browser, the name of your Internet service provider, the IP address of your PC, the address of the web page from which you accessed our website, the name of your operating system, the web pages you visit on our website, as well as the date and duration of your visit. This information is temporarily stored in the log files and automatically deleted afterward. The purpose of this storage is, in case of a problem, to enable an analysis of activities which possibly caused the fault.</p>

<h3>(1.2) Cookies</h3>

<p>Our online shop uses cookies, which are small files transferred to your PC by the web server. These files are used to track your movement from page to page in our online shop or to manage a shopping cart.</p>

<p>On the one hand, cookies are differentiated according to the duration of their storage. So-called session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. A session cookie can be used to manage a shopping cart or to record products of special interest, whereas permanent cookies remain stored on your PC. Information about the storage duration is provided by your browser. A permanent cookie can be reread the next time you visit our website. To prevent this, you can delete the permanent cookie after your visit to our website. Permanent cookies can for example be used to provide information from a shop website for use by an online payment service.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cookies are differentiated according to their origin. So-called first-party cookies always originate from the website indicated in your browser's address bar. So-called third-party cookies originate from websites which you have not visited directly, but have been tied into in the first-party's website by means of images or advertisements. Your browser can tell you the sources of the cookies stored on your PC.</p>

<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies. To disable this function, please change the corresponding settings of your browser. If your browser does not accept any cookies, you might not be able to visit all the web pages of our online shop without any trouble.
